#### _Hi everyone, my name is Manuel._

Manuel Bogoni is a water resources engineer, with experience in river engineering, hydraulics and hydrology.
He has worked both as researcher and as project engineering, with license as Civil Professional Engineer since 2014.

##### Education

Manuel holds a M.Sc. in Civil Engineering (2013) and a Ph.D. in Hydrodynamics (2017) from the University of Padova (Italy). During the Ph.D. he spent 6 months as Visiting Scholar in the Earth Science of the Rice University, Houston (TX, US). Research interests have concerned geomorphology and river morphodynamics, with focus on numerical modeling of meandering river evolution, and data analysis of natural planforms. He attended several national and international conferences and meeting, as speaker or poster presenter.

##### Experience

From 2017 to 2018 Manuel was a Postdoctoral researcher in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department of the University of Padova. Research topic concerned the mathematical and numerical modeling of fluvial morphodynamics. Moreover, he was appointed as lecturer of Advanced Fluid Mechanics within the Master Degree in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padova.
Academic experience includes also the supervision of undergraduate and graduate students in their thesis works, and the appointment as member of the examining committee for Hydraulics courses.

From 2018 to 2020 Manuel was a Project Engineer in Studio Altieri, an Italian engineering firm which is part of Italconsult Group. Duties included engineering design (river engineering, aqueduct and sewer networks, stormwater and drainage networks, wastewater treatment plants), expert advices (flood risk assessment, numerical modeling, technical audit), construction management (cost budgets, project validation, construction supervision), call for bids (tendering, proposal deliverables), and project management (stakeholder interface and coordination, Work Breakdown Structure, Gantt chart, deliverable planning, budget estimates).

Manuel is a hydrologist with passion for coding. He has so far developed numerical codes for the solution of problems dealing with open channel flow, gravity currents, flood risk, sediment transport, pipe flow, and catchment hydrology.
